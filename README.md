<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://countries-nu-black.vercel.app/)

I successfully implemented a Next.js website that integrates with the REST Countries API, allowing users to view all countries on the homepage, search for specific countries, filter by region, and access detailed information on a separate page. Users can also click through to bordering countries and experience a responsive layout. Additionally, I added a bonus feature allowing users to toggle between light and dark mode for an enhanced visual experience.

### Built With

- NextJS
- React
- Tailwind CSS
